Create an Apex class that uses Scheduled Apex to update Lead records.
Create an Apex class that implements the Schedulable interface to update Lead records with a specific LeadSource. Write unit tests that achieve 100% code coverage for the class. This is very similar to what you did for Batch Apex.
Create an Apex class called 'DailyLeadProcessor' that uses the Schedulable interface.
The execute method must find the first 200 Leads with a blank LeadSource field and update them with the LeadSource value of 'Dreamforce'.
Create an Apex test class called 'DailyLeadProcessorTest'.
In the test class, insert 200 Lead records, schedule the DailyLeadProcessor class to run and test that all Lead records were updated correctly.
The unit tests must cover all lines of code included in the DailyLeadProcessor class, resulting in 100% code coverage.
Run your test class at least once (via 'Run All' tests the Developer Console) before attempting to verify this challenge.

Main class
public class DailyLeadProcessor implements schedulable {
    public void execute(SchedulableContext ctx){
        List<Lead> nullleads = [select id,Name, LeadSource  from Lead where LeadSource =null limit 200];
        for(Integer i=0;i<200;i++){
            nullleads[i].LeadSource ='Dreamforce';
        }
        update nullleads;
    }
}

Testclass
@isTest
public class DailyLeadProcessorTest {
    @testSetup
    static void setup(){      
        List<Lead> testleads = new List<Lead>();
        for(Integer i=0;i<200;i++){
            Lead leadvar = new Lead();
            leadvar.LastName = 'test name' +i;
            leadvar.Company = 'seban consulting';
            testleads.add(leadvar);
        }
        
        insert testleads;    
    }
    static testmethod void testDailyleadprocess(){
            string CRON_EXP ='0 0 0 15 3 ? 2042';
            Test.startTest();
            String jobid = System.schedule('test lead run',CRON_EXP,new DailyLeadProcessor());
            Test.stopTest();
            List<Lead> leadcheck =[select id,Name, LeadSource  from Lead where LeadSource ='Dreamforce' and Company in ('seban consulting')];
            System.assertEquals(200,leadcheck.size());
        }
}
